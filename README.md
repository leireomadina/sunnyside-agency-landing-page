### How to run the project:

I chose to use the Adalab Starter Kit to work on this project, created using Node and Gulp. Make sure you have **[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)** installed in order to run it.

1. **Open the terminal** in the root folder of the repo.
2. **Install the local dependencies** using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start running the project** using the following command that will open a browser window that shows a live version of the page.

```bash
npm start
```
